This is inspired by the notebook version [here](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/blob/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/execute_time).

Note: for this to show anything, you need to enable cell timing in the notebook via Settings->Advanced Settings Editor->Notebook: `{"recordTiming": true}`
